  <h3>Bend It Like Beckham</h3>
   <p>The soundtrack is amazing.</p>
  <h3>The Color Purple</h3>
   <p>It's a heavy film, but I could watch it over and over again</p>
  <h3>The Mummy</h3>
   <p>It's an action-packed adventure/thriller, with beautiful leads and Egyptian folklore. What's not to love?</p>
